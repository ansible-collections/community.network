  3.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils``.
      deprecated_features:
      - Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be removed
        in the next major release (community.network 4.0.0) this spring. While most
        content will probably still work with ansible-base 2.10, we will remove symbolic
        links for modules and action plugins, which will make it impossible to use
        them with Ansible 2.9 anymore. Please use community.network 3.x.y with Ansible
        2.9 and ansible-base 2.10, as these releases will continue to support Ansible
        2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 even after they are End of Life (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/50,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/382).
