Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the FortiOS modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the FortiOS content by FQCN, like ``community.network.fmgr_device``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.fortios.fmgr_device`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.fortios`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.fortios`` if you are using any of the FortiOS modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.fortios) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``cp_publish`` module from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the module by FQCN, i.e. ``community.network.cp_publish``. Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``check_point.mgmt.cp_mgmt_publish``) and to make sure that you have ``check_point.mgmt`` installed.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``check_point.mgmt`` if you are using the ``cp_publish`` module. While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (check_point.mgmt) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use it by FQCN (``community.network.fortimanager``).
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCN ``fortinet.fortimanager.fortimanager`` and to make sure that you have ``fortinet.fortimanager`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``fortinet.fortimanager`` if you are using the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirect that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (fortinet.fortimanager) must be installed for it to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``nso`` modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the nso content by FQCN, like ``community.network.nso_config``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``cisco.nso.nso_config`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``cisco.nso`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``cisco.nso`` if you are using any of the ``nso`` modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (cisco.nso) must be installed for them to work.
- If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``routeros`` plugins or modules from this collections, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the routeros content by FQCN, like ``community.network.routeros_command``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.routeros.command`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.routeros`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.routeros`` if you are using any of the ``routeros`` plugins or modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.routeros) must be installed for them to work.
- cnos_static_route - move ipaddress import from ansible.netcommon to builtin or package before ipaddress is removed from ansible.netcommon. You need to make sure to have the ipaddress package installed if you are using this module on Python 2.7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/129).

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.fmgr_device`` → ``community.fortios.fmgr_device``) and make sure to install the `community.fortios` collection.
- All ``nso`` modules have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `cisco.nso <https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/nso>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.nso_config`` → ``cisco.nso.nso_config``) and make sure to install the `cisco.nso` collection.
- All ``routeros`` modules and plugins have been removed from this collection.
