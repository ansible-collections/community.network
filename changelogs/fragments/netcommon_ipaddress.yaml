  - cnos_static_route - move ipaddress import from ansible.netcommon to builtin
    or package before ipaddress is removed from ansible.netcommon. You need to
    make sure to have the ipaddress package installed if you are using this
    module on Python 2.7
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/129).
