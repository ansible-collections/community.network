  The ``cp_publish`` module has been removed from this collection.
  It was a duplicate of ``check_point.mgmt.cp_mgmt_publish`` in the `check_point.mgmt <https://galaxy.ansible.com/check_point/mgmt>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.cp_publish`` â†’ ``check_point.mgmt.cp_mgmt_publish``) and make sure to install the check_point.mgmt collection.
- The dependency on the ``check_point.mgmt`` collection has been removed. If you depend on that installing ``community.network`` also installs ``check_point.mgmt``, you have to make sure to install ``check_point.mgmt`` explicitly.
breaking_changes:
- >
  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``cp_publish`` module from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the module by FQCN, i.e. ``community.network.cp_publish``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``check_point.mgmt.cp_mgmt_publish``) and to make sure that you have ``check_point.mgmt`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``check_point.mgmt`` if you are using the ``cp_publish`` module.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (check_point.mgmt) must be installed for them to work.
