  The ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin has been removed from this collection.
  It was a duplicate of the one in the `fortinet.fortimanager <https://galaxy.ansible.com/fortinet/fortimanager>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, a redirection has been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.fortimanager`` → ``fortinet.fortimanager.fortimanager``) and make sure to install the `fortinet.fortimanager` collection.
- |
  All FortiOS modules and plugins have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `community.fortios <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/fortios>`_ collections, respectively.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.fmgr_device`` → ``community.fortios.fmgr_device``) and make sure to install the `community.fortios` collection.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use it by FQCN (``community.network.fortimanager``).
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCN ``fortinet.fortimanager.fortimanager`` and to make sure that you have ``fortinet.fortimanager`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``fortinet.fortimanager`` if you are using the ``fortimanager`` httpapi plugin.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirect that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (fortinet.fortimanager) must be installed for it to work.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the FortiOS modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the FortiOS content by FQCN, like ``community.network.fmgr_device``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.fortios.fmgr_device`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.fortios`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.fortios`` if you are using any of the FortiOS modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.fortios) must be installed for them to work.
