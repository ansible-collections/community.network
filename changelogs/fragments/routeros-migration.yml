  For community.network 2.0.0, the ``routeros`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.routeros <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/routeros>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use ``routeros`` content from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.routeros.`` instead of ``community.network.routeros_``,
  for example replace ``community.network.routeros_api`` in a task by ``community.routeros.api``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.network`` manually and rely on the ``routeros`` content, you have to make sure to install the ``community.routeros`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.network.routeros_command`` instead of ``routeros_command``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
