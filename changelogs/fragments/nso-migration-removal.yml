  All ``nso`` modules have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `cisco.nso <https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/nso>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.nso_config`` â†’ ``cisco.nso.nso_config``) and make sure to install the `cisco.nso` collection.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``nso`` modules from this collection, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the nso content by FQCN, like ``community.network.nso_config``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``cisco.nso.nso_config`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``cisco.nso`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``cisco.nso`` if you are using any of the ``nso`` modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (cisco.nso) must be installed for them to work.
