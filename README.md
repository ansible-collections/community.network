# Community Network Collection

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.network/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=stable-3)](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.network/_build?definitionId=32&_a=summary&repositoryFilter=32&branchFilter=2616%2C2616)

This repository contains the `community.network` Ansible Collection. The collection is a part of the `ansible` package and includes many network modules and plugins supported by Ansible community which are not part of more specialized community collections.

You can find [documentation for this collection on the Ansible docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/network/).

## Installing this collection

This collection is shipped with the `ansible` package. So if you have it installed, no more action is required.

If you have a minimal installation (only Ansible Core installed) or you want to use the latest version of the collection along with the whole `ansible` package, you need to install the collection from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/network) manually with the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.network

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.network
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
```

Note that if you install the collection manually, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.network --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any [available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/network):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.network:==X.Y.Z
```
See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Using this collection

You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN), such as `community.network.a10_server`.
The following example task creates a new server load balancer object on an A10 Networks device, using the FQCN:

```yaml
---
    - name: Create a new server
      community.network.a10_server:
        host: a10.mydomain.com
        username: myadmin
        password: mypassword
        partition: mypartition
        server: test
        server_ip: 192.0.2.100
        server_ports:
          - port_num: 8080
            protocol: tcp
          - port_num: 8443
            protocol: TCP
```

Alternately, you can call modules by their short name if you list the `community.network` collection in the playbook's `collections`, as follows:

```yaml
---
- hosts: "{{desired_inventory_group}}"
  connection: local

  collections:
    - community.network

  tasks:
    - name: Create a new server
      a10_server:
            host: a10.mydomain.com
            username: myadmin
            password: mypassword
            partition: mypartition
            server: test
            server_ip: 192.0.2.100
            server_ports:
              - port_num: 8080
                protocol: tcp
              - port_num: 8443
                protocol: TCP
```
