ancestor: 4.0.0
releases:
  5.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Collection core functions - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils``.
      - Include ``PSF-license.txt`` file for ``plugins/module_utils/_version.py``.
      - Include ``simplified_bsd.txt`` license file for the ``icx`` and ``netvisor``
        module utils.
      - ce - Modify the bug in the query configuration method (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/56).
      - community.network.ce_switchport - fix error causing by ``KeyError:`` ``host``
        due to properties aren't used anywhere (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/313)
      - exos_config - fix a hang due to an unexpected prompt during save_when (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/110).
      - weos4 cliconf plugin - fix linting errors in documentation data (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/368).
      major_changes:
      - The community.network collection no longer supports Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base
        2.10. While we take no active measures to prevent usage, we will remove compatibility
        code and other compatility measures that will effectively prevent using most
        content from this collection with Ansible 2.9, and some content of this collection
        with ansible-base 2.10. Both Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 will very soon
        be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading
        to ansible-core 2.11 or later as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/426).
      - The internal structure of the collection was changed for modules and action
        plugins. These no longer live in a directory hierarchy ordered by topic, but
        instead are now all in a single (flat) directory. This has no impact on users
        *assuming they did not use internal FQCNs*. These will still work, but result
        in deprecation warnings. They were never officially supported and thus the
        redirects are kept as a courtsey, and this is not labelled as a breaking change.
        Note that for example the Ansible VScode plugin started recommending these
        internal names. If you followed its recommendation, you will now have to change
        back to the short names to avoid deprecation warnings, and potential errors
        in the future as these redirects will be removed in community.network 8.0.0
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/482).
      minor_changes:
      - community.network.ce_switchport - add support of decode a few stdout values
        from bitmap to human readable format(https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/315)
      - community.network.edgeos_config - append save command into result (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/189)
      release_summary: This is release 5.0.0 of the community.network collection.
