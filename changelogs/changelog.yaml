      - cnos_static_route - move ipaddress import from ansible.netcommon to builtin
        or package before ipaddress is removed from ansible.netcommon. You need to
        make sure to have the ipaddress package installed if you are using this module
        on Python 2.7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/129).
      bugfixes:
      - action pugins - add check for network_cli connection type (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/119,

        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/131).
      - dladm_vnic - vlan IDs 0 and 4095 are now correctly identified as invalid (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/132).
      - edgeos_config - Added `cat` command to allow display of large files without
        `less`. Led to a timeout error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/issues/79)

        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/78)
