removed_features:

  All ``routeros`` modules and plugins have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `community.routeros <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/routeros>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.network.routeros_command`` â†’ ``community.routeros.command``) and make sure to install the community.routeros collection.
breaking_changes:

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``routeros`` plugins or modules from this collections, community.network 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the routeros content by FQCN, like ``community.network.routeros_command``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.routeros.command`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.routeros`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.network manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.routeros`` if you are using any of the ``routeros`` plugins or modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.network 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.routeros) must be installed for them to work.
