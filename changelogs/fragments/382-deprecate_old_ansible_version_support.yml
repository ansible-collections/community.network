deprecated_features:
  - "Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be removed in the next major release (community.network 4.0.0) this spring.
     While most content will probably still work with ansible-base 2.10, we will remove symbolic links for modules and action plugins, which will make
     it impossible to use them with Ansible 2.9 anymore. Please use community.network 3.x.y with Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10, as these releases
     will continue to support Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 even after they are End of Life
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/50, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.network/pull/382)."
